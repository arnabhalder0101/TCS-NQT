Why do I need Health Insurance? \n     Healthcare is expensive. Technological advances, new procedures and more effective medicines have driven up the \n     cost of healthcare. This increase has to be borne by the consumer, making treatment unaffordable for too many. \n     Health Insurance overcomes these obstacles so that you remain free of anxiety regarding your health. Think for a \n     moment about the enormous medical costs you would incur if you suffered a major accident tomorrow or were \n     suddenly stricken by an illness. Uninsured people live with such risks everyday. Health insurance seeks to shield you \n     from that risk. It provides the much needed financial relief. You also get tax benefit under section 80D of the Income \n     Tax Act and amendments made thereto. \n2. How will health insurance pay for my emergency medical expenses? \n     Your health insurance will either pay your hospital bills directly if opted for the cashless facility or it will reimburse \n     any payment made by you towards medical expenses incurred due to an illness or injury as per the policy terms. \n3. What do you mean by Family Floater Policy? \n     Family Floater is one single policy that takes care of the hospitalization expenses of your entire family. The policy has \n     one single sum insured, which can be utilized by any/all insured persons in any proportion or amount subject to \n     maximum of overall limit of the policy sum insured, as per policy terms and conditions. \n4. Will my health insurance cover begin from day one? \n     When you get a new policy, there will be a 30 days waiting period starting from the policy inception date, during \n     which period any hospitalization charges will not be payable by the insurance companies. However, this is not \n     applicable to any emergency hospitalization occurring due to an accident. This waiting period will not be applicable \n     for subsequent policies under renewal. Furthermore, in the case of a declared & accepted pre-existing disease or \n     specific diseases, you will have to serve the waiting period of 2 years for these diseases / conditions. \n5. What is pre-existing condition in health insurance policy? \n     It is a medical condition/disease that existed before you obtained health insurance policy \n6. If my policy is not renewed in time before expiry date, will it be denied for renewal? \n     The policy will be renewable provided you pay the premium within 30 days (called as Grace Period) of expiry date. \n     However, coverage would not be available for the period for which no premium is received by Us. The policy will \n     lapse if the premium is not paid within the grace period. \n7. What happens to the policy coverage after a claim is filed? \n     After a claim is filed and settled, the policy coverage is reduced by the amount that has been paid out on settlement. \n     For Example: In January you start a policy with a coverage of ₹5 Lakh for the year. In April, you make a claim of \n     ₹2 Lakh. The coverage available to you for the May to December will be the balance of ₹3 Lakh. \n8.   What is Reset Benefit ? \n     It is a benefit that allows an insured to reinstate the entire sum insured in the policy year when it gets exhausted \n     due to incurred claims. In case the entire cover is exhausted, it gets replenished automatically for the next \n     hospitalization that occurs within the policy year. Reset will not trigger on first claim and reset will triggered once for \n     same person for same illness for which the claim has already been paid in the policy. \n9. Does my policy offer worldwide cover? \n     Complete Health Insurance policy with Sum Insured 25 lacs and above Hospitalization expenses incurred \n     abroad with a co-pay of 10% \n10. What is covered under Domiciliary Hospitalization? \n     Domiciliary Hospitalization offers coverage for medical expenses in a situation where the Insured Person is in such \n     a state that he/she cannot be moved to a hospital or the treatment is taken at home if there's a non-availability of \n     room in the hospital. \n11. What is Guaranteed Cumulative Bonus [GCB]? \n     GCB will be 20% every year upto 100% of SI ; with no reduction in case of claims. \n12. What is the maximum Sum Insured under the new plans? \n     All plans come with multiple Sum Insured options up to a maximum upto 100 lakh. \n13. Can I increase my Sum Insured at the time of renewal? \n     Yes, you can increase the Sum Insured at the time of renewal. However, fresh waiting period would apply for the \n     enhanced Sum Insured (this condition would not apply on the original sum insured including the accrued \n     Gauranteed Cumulative Bonus \n<<<\f\n\n    : Waiting period of 2 years is applicable.
